I'm a Life rank Boy Scout working toward becoming an Eagle Scout. My interest in FTC began with my love for building and designing things, especially with Legos. I also have two cousins who compete in FRC, which inspired me to get involved in robotics. After learning more about it, I started doing robotics at my school and began exploring the world of the First Tech Challenge. Since then, I've gained valuable problem-solving skills and have learned so much through hands-on experience.</p>

Some of my hobbies are playing the violin, tennis, chess, swimming, and basketball. I am passionate to learn programming languages such as Python, Arduino, and Java. I am inspired to join the FIRST program by spectating FTC competitions. I enjoyed watching robots compete and looking at the various types of robots. In the previous years I have done Destination Imagination and had the opportunity to attend Global Finals. I am very excited to be a part of the Robo Phantoms team.</p>

                    <p class="member-bio">Hi, my name is Aarvi Thota. I'm 12 years old and currently in 7th grade at Sartartia Middle School. My hobbies are playing the violin, volleyball, biking, reading, and doing creative activities like designing presentations on Canva. I enjoy participating in STEM activities and challenges. In the past, I competed in Destination Imagination in both Technical and Engineering challenges, and I've been participating in the Science Fair for the past three years. I'm also part of the Girls Who Code club, where I'm learning new technologies and skills. I'm curious and always want to learn about how to build and program robots. I'm very excited to be part of the Robo Phantoms FTC team.</p>
